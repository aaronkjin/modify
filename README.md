## Background

Say I'm not at my desk where I may be studying for an upcoming exam or building a personal project. Then, you'll most likely come across me _either_ playing the oboe _or_ listening to music with Airpods on. As an avid music-listening enjoyer with 80,000+ minutes listened to on Spotify last year as well as being a musician myself, it is safe to say that I am deeply connected to the power of music. Building a Spotify-like application seemed like the perfect way to merge my coding skills with my passion for music.

Thus, I built Modify, a full-stack Spotify clone application that allows users to upload and play songs of their choice, "like" their favorite songs to put into a "Liked Songs" playlist, pay for Premium features through Stripe (albeit, with imaginary credit card information), and many, many more features. Modify replicates many of Spotify's core features, both basic and advanced.

## Future Directions

The next phase for Modify includes integrating Spotifyâ€™s API to expand the range of available music and enhance the user experience. This project is a stepping stone towards creating more advanced, fully integrated music services.
