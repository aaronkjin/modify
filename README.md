### Background and Inspiration

Say I'm not at my desk â€” studying for an upcoming exam or building a personal project. Then you'll most likely come across me _either_ playing the oboe _or_ listening to music with Airpods on. As an avid music-listening enjoyer with 80,000+ minutes listened to on Spotify last year as well as being a musician myself, I thought that building a Spotify clone web application would shed a bit more light into who I am as an individual. Because, after all, I do indeed love music. Plus, Spotify is my most used app. Thus, I built Modify, a full-stack Spotify clone application that allows users to upload and play their favorite songs, "like" their favorite songs for a "Liked Songs" playlist, pay for Premium features through Stripe, and many more features.

### Details and Features

- Technologies used: TypeScript, React, Next, Tailwind, Stripe, Supabase, and PostgreSQL.
- Song upload
- Play song audio
- Favorites system
- Playlists / Liked Songs system
- Advanced Player component
- A sleek, seamless UI with animations and transition effects using Tailwind
- Credential authentication using Supabase
- GitHub authentication integration
- File and image upload using Supabase storage
- Client form validation and handling using react-hook-form
- Server error handling with react-toast
- APP/API exposure with writing POST, GET, and DELETE routes in route handlers
- Direct access of the database to fetch data in server React components (without the use of APIs)
- Handling of relations between Server and Child components in a real-time environment
- Integration of recurring payments and cancellation of subscriptions using Stripe
- Full responsiveness for all devices

**If you want to try the site for yourself:**
1. Click the link above.
2. Sign up through email or GitHub. You should receive an email as a confirmation link.
3. Upon signing up, you are logged in! Feel free to browse around the site to see its features.
4. To upload a song, click the "+" by the "Your Library" component. This allows you to upload any MP3 and image file of your choice.
5. Play around with the features! You can like, search for, and play/pause the song of your choice + more.

### Notes

This project is currently under development. I am still working on the integration of a subscription model (built through Stripe), and once that is finalized, I will be deploying the website. The link for that will be available soon.
